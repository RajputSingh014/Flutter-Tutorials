# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Flutter Tutorials! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible. Please take a moment to review this document **before submitting a pull request**.

In the repo you can contribute by:
- Adding tutorials for the existing Flutter code snippets
- Translating the tutorials
- Adding new Flutter code snippets for the new and upcoming Flutter widgets
- Improve CONTRIBUTING.md, and README.md

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Name the branch like `tutorial/[widget-name]` and add new tutorial and code snippet
3. Create `readme.md` inside your `tutorial/[widget-name]` with your code-snippet tutorial. You can write whole explanation for the same. 
4. Submit your PR for review

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors to first check if there is any tutorial that already exists similar to the one you are going to publish. If the existing tutorial, and code-snippet can be improved then you can create PR by updating it. Furthermore, you can create [an issue](https://github.com/raunakhajela/Flutter-Tutorials/issues) to discuss the same.
